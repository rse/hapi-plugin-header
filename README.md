About
-----

This is a small plugin for the [HAPI](http://hapijs.com/) server
framework for always sending one or more custom HTTP headers,
independent of the current route. The header values can be provided
synchronously or asynchronously (via Promises).

Usage
-----

```js
await server.register({
    plugin: require("hapi-plugin-header"),
    options: {
        "Server":        "Example/1.2.3",
        "X-Request-Id":  (server, request, h) => request.info.id,
        "X-External-IP": (server, request, h) => {
            return Request.get("http://myexternalip.com/raw")
                .then((value) => value.replace(/\r?\n/g, ""))
        }
    }
})
```
